                As a wise friend of mine once said, "Privacy is a privelege nowadays". Along these lines lies the story of the genesis of this site.
                The introduction of the site states that this site serves as my CV/Resume it also serves as my social media site, if I care to share anything about myself I shall post it here.
                The goal is to go back to some kind of retro social network where your website/webpage is your <i>social media account</i>, I beleieve this goes something along the lines of the yesterweb community.

                I also would like to share my ideas with the world. My gameplay, my code and my thoughts so this also serves as a platform for that. I've also been making websites since I was 14 years old, but those were just experiments I also suck at Javascript (more like I refuse to learn it)
                Maybe my articles/tutorials can help somebody or others might enjoy my gameplay, I will also be setting up a <i>shop</i> of sorts to sell propietary software and 3D builds, bots, etc. <br><br>

                I will be posting my age of empires finds, build orders and stuff like that here as well, hopefully serving as a guide to other players while I myself learn from my gameplay and feedback from others, as stated previously I wish to play in Nations cup, an internation event for AoE2.<br>
                Documentation for any major software I write will also be hosted here, so that's that. <br>

                This website will remain cookie free and that's a promise! 
                This site is inspired by a lot of yesterweb sites, I will be linking them sometime in the future. 
                
                And that is all for this blog folks, I will be writing more and posting more so stay tuned. I'll probably add an RSS feed option as well if possible.
